🟢 <h2>Basic Scan</h2>
===========================

1. <h3>📝 Executive Summary</h3>

The basic scan of https://plantedmeals.ca found several potential issues that could impact the security and performance of the website. ✅ The scan detected no major vulnerabilities, but did find some configuration issues that should be addressed.

• ⚠️ The site uses TLS encryption, but the Strict-Transport-Security HTTP header is not defined.
• 🔴 The anti-clickjacking X-Frame-Options header is not present, which could allow clickjacking attacks.
• 🔴 The X-Content-Type-Options header is not set, which could allow user agents to render content in a different way than intended.
