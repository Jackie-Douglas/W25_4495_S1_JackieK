<h2>Full Port Scan</h2>**Network Scan Result Analysis**

**Command:** `nmap` command with default settings, used to perform a network scan.

**What does this command do?**
This command performs a network scan on a single IP address (not specified in the output) using Nmap version 7.95. The scan checks for hosts that are up and responding to ping probes, as well as other network-related information.

**Risks detected:**
None. The output indicates that all hosts were found to be down or not responding to ping probes.

**Analysis of the output:**

* The command was executed successfully.
* The output reports that no hosts were found to be up and responsive.
* The note suggests trying the `-Pn` option if the host is really up but blocking ping probes, which implies that the host may be intentionally not responding to ping requests.

**Remediation steps:**
1. If the host is intentionally blocking ping probes, try using the `-Pn` option with Nmap to force the scan to proceed.
2. Check network logs and system logs for any signs of suspicious activity or malicious traffic that might indicate a security issue.
3. Verify the connectivity and response times of other hosts on the same network.

**Severity:**
The detected issue is low-severity, as it only indicates that the host(s) are not responding to ping probes. However, if the host is intentionally blocking probes, this could be an indication of potential security issues or misconfiguration.

**Command Analysis:**
The command used in this network scan is `nmap`, a popular open-source tool for network exploration and security auditing. The specific command used appears to be a simple IP address scan, which sends a probe packet to the target host and checks if it responds.

**Detected Risks:**
Based on the output, no risks are detected. The report indicates that all hosts scanned were found to be "down", meaning they did not respond to the ping probes sent by Nmap.

**Output Analysis:**
The output suggests that the target host or hosts did not respond to the scan, indicating a lack of connectivity or active network services. This could be due to various reasons such as:

* The host is actually down (e.g., power outage, hardware failure)
* The host is behind a firewall or intrusion detection system that blocks ping probes
* The host is not configured to respond to ICMP echo requests

**Remediation Steps:**

1. Verify the host's status: If the host is truly down, no further action is required. However, if it is simply blocking ping probes, consider using Nmap's `-Pn` option to force a full scan.
2. Check network connectivity: Ensure that the scanning device has proper network connectivity and can reach other hosts on the same network.
3. Investigate firewall or IDS configurations: If the host is behind a firewall or IDS, investigate its configuration to determine why it is blocking ping probes.

**Severity Analysis:**
The detected issue is considered LOW severity, as there are no active services or potential vulnerabilities identified. However, if the host is intentionally blocking ping probes for security reasons, this may indicate a more serious security posture and warrant further investigation.

**Conclusion:**
This network scan report indicates that the target host(s) did not respond to the ping probe, suggesting a lack of connectivity or active network services. The severity of the issue is considered LOW, but further investigation into the host's status and potential firewall or IDS configurations may be warranted to ensure proper network security.<hr><h2>HTTP Vulnerability (CVE-2017-5638)</h2>**Network Scan Result Analysis**
