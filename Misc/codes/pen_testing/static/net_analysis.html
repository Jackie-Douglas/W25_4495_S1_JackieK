<h2>Full Port Scan</h2>**Structured Report Format**

**Command Analysis:**
The command used in this scan is Nmap, a network scanning tool that provides information about hosts and services on a network. This specific scan uses various options to perform a comprehensive analysis of the target host, including OS detection, service detection, and port scanning.

**Risks Detected:**
This scan detects several risks:

1. **Unsecured HTTP Ports:** The scan reveals multiple unsecured HTTP ports (80/tcp, 2052/tcp, etc.) that can be exploited by attackers.
2. **Cloudflare Proxies:** The presence of Cloudflare proxies on multiple ports (80/tcp, 443/tcp, etc.) suggests potential security risks, as these proxies can be used to manipulate traffic and hide malicious activities.

**Analysis:**
The output indicates that the target host is up and responding to requests. The scan detects several open ports, including HTTP ports with Cloudflare proxies. This suggests that the host may be vulnerable to attacks exploiting unsecured HTTP ports or manipulated by Cloudflare proxies.

1. **OS Detection:** The scan attempts to detect the operating system running on the host but does not provide a conclusive result due to the lack of open and closed ports.
2. **Service Detection:** The scan detects multiple services, including HTTP and HTTPS, on various ports, indicating that the host is likely hosting web applications.

**Remediation Steps:**
To address these risks, consider the following steps:

1. **Secure HTTP Ports:** Implement SSL/TLS encryption on all open HTTP ports to prevent eavesdropping and tampering.
2. **Configure Cloudflare Proxies:** Ensure that Cloudflare proxies are properly configured to filter out malicious traffic and block unauthorized access.
3. **Monitor Network Traffic:** Regularly monitor network traffic to detect any suspicious or unusual activity.

**Severity:**
The detected risks have a medium to high severity, as they can be exploited by attackers to compromise the host's security. Prompt remediation steps are necessary to mitigate these risks and ensure the host's security.

**Additional Recommendations:**

1. **Conduct Regular Security Audits:** Perform regular security audits to identify vulnerabilities and address them promptly.
2. **Implement Firewalls:** Configure firewalls to block unauthorized access and restrict incoming traffic to only necessary ports.
3. **Keep Software Up-to-Date:** Ensure that all software, including the operating system and applications, is up-to-date with the latest security patches.

By taking these remediation steps and implementing additional recommendations, you can significantly reduce the risks detected by this scan and improve the host's overall security posture.<hr><h2>SMB & RDP Vulnerability Scan</h2>**Network Scan Report**

**Command:** `nmap 199.34.228.73`

**What it does:** The command runs a network scan using Nmap to identify open ports and services on the specified IP address (199.34.228.73) and domain name (plantedmeals.ca).

**Risks detected:**

* **NetBIOS Service (139/tcp)**: This port is filtered, indicating that it may be hiding or not responding.
* **Microsoft-DS (445/tcp)**: This port is also filtered, suggesting potential issues with file sharing or Active Directory services.
* **MS-WBT Server (3389/tcp)**: This port is filtered, which could indicate problems with remote desktop connections.

**Analysis of output:**

The scan results suggest that the targeted IP address and domain name are up and responsive. However, three ports are filtered, indicating potential issues with network services. The filtered ports may be hiding or not responding to incoming traffic, making it difficult to determine their actual status.

**Remediation steps:**

1. **Investigate filtered ports:** Review the system logs and network configuration to determine why these ports are filtered.
2. **Secure NetBIOS and Microsoft-DS services:** Ensure that these services are properly configured and secured to prevent unauthorized access.
3. **Configure MS-WBT Server:** Verify that the remote desktop service is properly configured and secure.

**Severity of detected issue:**

The severity of this issue depends on the specific circumstances and potential vulnerabilities associated with each filtered port. However, as a general rule, filtered ports can indicate potential security risks, such as:

* Unauthorized access to file shares or Active Directory services
* Inadequate configuration or security of remote desktop connections

To determine the actual severity, further investigation is necessary.

**Recommendation:**

Perform additional analysis and remediation steps to address the filtered ports and ensure the overall security posture of the network.<hr>
