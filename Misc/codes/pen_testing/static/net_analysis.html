Here is a beginner-friendly HTML report with the given layout:

**Report Title**
===========================

**Summary**

This report provides an overview of the results from scanning the target IP address, `199.34.228.73`. The scan was performed using Nmap and revealed information about the operating system, services running on the host, and network distance.

**OS Detection**
---------------

According to the scan results, the host is likely running a variant of **FreeBSD 12.0-RELEASE - 12.1-RELEASE**, with an accuracy of 90%. This is based on Nmap's aggressive OS guessing algorithm, which may not always be accurate. No exact matches were found for the host.

**Services Running**
------------------

The scan revealed multiple services running on the host:

* **http** on ports 2082, 2083, 2086, 2095, and 8080
* **ssl/http** on ports 2087, 2096, and 8443

These services are likely related to Cloudflare's content delivery network (CDN) or other web-based applications.

**Network Distance**
-----------------

The scan also provided information about the network distance between the scanning host and the target IP address. The results show a network distance of **5 hops**, indicating that the target host is located 5 network segments away from the scanning host.

**Traceroute Results**
-------------------

Here are the detailed Traceroute results:

**Additional Notes**

Please note that the results of this scan may not be exhaustive or entirely accurate, as Nmap's OS detection and service scanning algorithms are subject to limitations and uncertainties.
