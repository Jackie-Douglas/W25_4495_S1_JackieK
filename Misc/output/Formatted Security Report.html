<div class="section"><h2>SMB Vulnerability (MS08-067)</h2><p>**Network Scan Report**

<br><br><strong style="color:blue;">Command:</strong><br> The command 
used in this scan is `nmap`, which is a network scanning tool that 
provides information about hosts and services on a network.

<br><br><strong style="color:blue;">Risks Detected:</strong><br>

* **Port 445 (microsoft-ds) filtered**: This port is typically 
associated with the Server Message Block (SMB) protocol, which is often 
used for file sharing and remote access. The fact that this port is 
"filtered" suggests that there may be a firewall or other security 
measure blocking incoming traffic on this port.

<br><br><strong style="color:blue;">Analysis of Output:</strong><br>

* The host at IP address 199.34.228.73 is up and responding to requests.
* The reverse DNS (rDNS) record for the IP address points to 
`pages-custom-25.weebly.com`, which suggests that this IP address may be
 associated with a website or other online presence.
* Port 445 is filtered, indicating that there may be a security measure 
blocking incoming traffic on this port.

<br><br><strong style="color:blue;">Remediation Steps:</strong><br>

1. **Check SMB configuration**: Verify that the SMB service is properly 
configured and secured. Ensure that only necessary services are 
listening on port 445.
2. **Review firewall rules**: Review the firewall rules to ensure that 
they are allowing incoming traffic on port 445 as needed, while still 
blocking unauthorized access.

**Severity of Detected Issue:**

The detected issue with port 445 being filtered is considered a moderate
 risk. If an attacker can exploit this vulnerability, they may be able 
to gain access to the SMB service and potentially compromise the system 
or steal sensitive data. However, if the firewall rules are properly 
configured and only necessary services are listening on port 445, the 
risk is significantly reduced.

<br><br><strong style="color:blue;">Recommendations:</strong><br>

* Conduct a thorough review of SMB configuration and firewall rules to 
ensure they are secure and aligned with organizational security 
policies.
* Implement additional security measures as needed to prevent 
unauthorized access to the SMB service.
* Monitor network traffic and system logs for suspicious activity 
related to port 445.</p></div>
<div class="section"><h2>SMTP Vulnerability (CVE-2011-1720)</h2><p>**Network Scan Result Analysis**

<br><br><strong style="color:blue;">Command:</strong><br> The command 
used is `nmap` (version 7.95) to scan the IP address `199.34.228.73`, 
which corresponds to the domain `plantedmeals.ca`.

<br><br><strong style="color:blue;">Risks Detected:</strong><br>
No specific risks are detected by this network scan. However, the scan 
reveals some potential issues related to port usage and network 
connectivity.

<br><br><strong style="color:blue;">Analysis of Output:</strong><br>

* The host is up and responding to queries (0.0098s latency).
* The reverse DNS (rDNS) record for the IP address `199.34.228.73` 
points to `pages-custom-25.weebly.com`, which may indicate that the 
domain name does not resolve correctly.
* Port 25 (`smtp`) is filtered, indicating that it is either blocked or 
not actively listening.

<br><br><strong style="color:blue;">Remediation Steps:</strong><br>

1. **Verify DNS configuration:** Ensure that the DNS records for 
`plantedmeals.ca` are correct and properly configured to point to the IP
 address `199.34.228.73`. This may involve updating the domain's DNS 
settings.
2. **Check email server configuration:** Since port 25 (`smtp`) is
