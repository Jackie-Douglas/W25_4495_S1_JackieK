        <h1>Remediation Report</h1>
        <pre>**Remediation Steps**

The security scan reveals several potential vulnerabilities that require attention. Here are the remediation steps for each finding:

1. **TCP Port 80 (HTTP) - Heroku Router**:
	* Severity: Low
	* Remediation: Since this is a custom response from the Heroku Router, it's not considered a vulnerability. However, if you're concerned about security, consider implementing proper authentication and authorization mechanisms for your web applications.
2. **TCP Port 443 (HTTPS) - Heroku Router**:
	* Severity: Low
	* Remediation: Same as above, this is a custom response from the Heroku Router and not a vulnerability.

No other vulnerabilities were detected in the scan.

**Final Summary**

The security scan did not reveal any significant vulnerabilities. The scan focused on TCP ports 80 (HTTP) and 443 (HTTPS), which are commonly targeted by attackers. However, the responses received were custom and not indicative of common web application vulnerabilities.

In summary:

* No critical or high-severity vulnerabilities were found.
* Low-severity findings related to Heroku Router's custom responses.
* No other issues were detected.

To further improve security, consider implementing proper authentication and authorization mechanisms for your web applications. Additionally, ensure that your systems are up-to-date with the latest security patches and configurations.

**Next Steps**

1. Review system logs and audit trails to identify potential security incidents or anomalies.
2. Implement regular vulnerability scanning and penetration testing to detect potential issues early on.
3. Consider implementing a Web Application Firewall (WAF) to help protect against common web-based attacks.
4. Ensure that your systems are configured to follow best practices for security, such as limiting access to sensitive data and configuring firewalls correctly.

By following these steps and regularly monitoring system logs, you can improve the overall security posture of your systems and reduce the risk of a successful attack.</pre>
