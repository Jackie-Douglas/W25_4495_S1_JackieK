## 🛠️ Project Overview

**NShield** is an intelligent, user-friendly automated scanning tool tailored for penetration testers, students, and cybersecurity professionals. Developed using Python and Flask, NShield performs comprehensive **network and web application vulnerability scans** using industry-standard tools like **Nmap** and **Nikto**. 

What sets NShield apart is its built-in AI integration using **Ollama**, which analyzes scan outputs and generates detailed reports that include:
- Vulnerability descriptions
- Risk assessments
- Severity ratings
- Remediation strategies

The result is a streamlined security assessment process that reduces complexity and increases accessibility—even for those with limited cybersecurity experience.
