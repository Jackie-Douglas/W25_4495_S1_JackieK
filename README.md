Objectives
The primary objective of this research is to design and implement an Annual Internal Penetration Testing Plan that integrates with an automated tool to enhance organizational cybersecurity practices. The goal is to provide a standardized, scalable, and resource-efficient solution that helps organizations conduct thorough internal penetration tests regularly.

Another key objective is to validate the effectiveness of the automated tool in identifying vulnerabilities within simulated environments. This involves testing the toolâ€™s performance against parameters like accuracy, speed, and adaptability. By assessing these metrics, the research ensures that the tool is practical for real-world use and meets the dynamic needs of modern IT environments.
